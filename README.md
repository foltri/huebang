# Hue Bang
Hue Bang is an Android application that controls the light effects, that were designed for Bang the dice game.
The 9 lamps and their names that the application uses are the followings:

1.  Desk lamp over the game play area (1 Hue Spotlight): 
  - Top lamp
2.  Player lamps in front of the players (3 Hue Gos):
  - P1 lamp
  - P2 lamp
  - P3 lamp
4.  Sun lamp on a box on the table (1 Hue Go): 
  - Sun lamp
3.  Ambiance lamps (4 Hue bulbs):
  - Facing one of the walls (1st - big lamp closer to the Sun lamp, 2nd - small lamp further from the Sun lamp):
    - Ambi11
    - Ambi12
  - Facing the other wall (1st - big lamp closer to the Sun lamp, 2nd - small lamp further from the Sun lamp):
    - Ambi21
    - Ambi22

  
The application can only control the lamps if their names match the ones above. 
In case some lamps are missing, the application can still control the rest of them. 

IMPORTANT: Before using the application, the "Hue animations" folder has to be placed in the root folder of the phone! This folder contains the frame files for the light effects. The compressed folder can be downladed [here] (http://bit.ly/1hX3NuQ).
