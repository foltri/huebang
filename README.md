# Hue Bang
Hue Bang is an Android application that controls the light effects, that were designed for Bang the dice game.
The 9 lamps and their names needed to use the application are the followings:

1.  Desk lamp over the game play area (1 Hue Spotlight): 
  - Top lamp
2.  Player lamps in front of the players (3 Hue Gos):
  - P1 lamp
  - P2 lamp
  - P3 lamp
3.  Ambiance lamps (4 Hue bulbs):
  - Facing one of the walls:
    - Ambi11
    - Ambi12
  - Facing the other wall:
    - Ambi21
    - Ambi22
4.  Sun lamp on a box on the table (1 Hue Go): 
  - Sun lamp
  
The application can only control the lamps if their names match the ones above. 
In case some lamps are missing, the application can still control the rest of them. 

IMPORTANT: Before using the application, the "Hue animations" folder has to be placed in the root folder of the phone! This folder contains the frame files for the light effects. The compressed folder can be downladed [here] (http://bit.ly/1hX3NuQ).
